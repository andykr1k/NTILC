# Next Steps

## Completed
- Finished naive ablation implementation
- Finished cross attention implementation
- Fixed data generator with more determinstic results
- Visualized embeddings of tool calls in notebook

## Working
- Fix autoencoder training pipeline
- Reduce memory footprint for autoencoder training
- Fix cross attention implementation
- Get meaningful embeddings & think about how params are being represented

## Future Work
- Full ablation studies
- Integrate LLM
- Hyperparam tuning
