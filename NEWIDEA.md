# New Possible Direction?

## Embed a large database of tool calls into a high dimensional space (1024)

## Project into a smaller dimensional space for contrastive loss (128)

## Use circle loss for clustering in embedding space 

## When predicting a tool use the circle loss cluster "similarity" index

## Some software lies on top that has an index of the cluster ideas mapped to the tools

## Software then passes arguments that are necessary to complete the "task" or we pass all possible arguments 

## Depending on if we have the necessary arguments or a list of all possible arguments, we can use a diffusion model to generate the values and none if a specific argument is not needed.
